## Context
The application needs to be accessible and fully functional on mobile devices and tablets. Following the KIRSS principle, we will make minimal necessary changes to ensure good mobile experience while maintaining existing functionality.

### Implementation Progress (2025-05-11)
- Created a flexible `useMediaQuery` hook for responsive feature toggling
- Added predefined breakpoints to match Tailwind's defaults (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- Created a ResponsiveIndicator component for development visual feedback
- Resolved build issues related to xmldom dependency in arxiv.ts
- Fixed issues with theme context to ensure proper rendering across screen sizes
- Created comprehensive documentation for responsive development

### Key Approach
- Use existing Tailwind responsive utilities where possible
- Convert sidebar to bottom navigation on small screens
- Transform paper table to card view on mobile
- Ensure proper touch target sizes (44x44px minimum)
- Test thoroughly across multiple screen sizes

### Next Steps
- Proceed with updating AppLayout for mobile-first design
- Implement bottom navigation for small screens
- Convert paper components to responsive layouts
