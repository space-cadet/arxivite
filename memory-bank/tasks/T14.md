**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: 2025-05-13
**Completed**: 2025-05-13
**Dependencies**: T7 (Search State Persistence)

## Completion Criteria
- ✅ Scroll position persists when navigating away and back to pages
- ✅ Paper expanded/collapsed states persist across navigation
- ✅ State persistence works on all paper list pages (Catchup, Search, Bookmarks)
- ✅ Works consistently in both mobile and desktop views

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Implementation
- ✅ Created useScrollState hook for scroll position persistence
- ✅ Created usePaperState hook for expanded state persistence

## Context
This enhancement improves user experience by maintaining UI state across navigation. When users navigate away from a page and return, they'll find:
1. The page scrolled to their previous position
2. Previously expanded papers still expanded
3. State maintained separately for each page

## Technical Notes
- Uses localStorage through usePersistedState
- State keys are page-specific (e.g., 'scroll.search', 'papers.search')
- Minimal performance impact due to efficient state updates
