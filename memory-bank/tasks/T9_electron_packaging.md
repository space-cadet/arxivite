# T9: Electron App Packaging
*Created: 2025-04-27*

**Description**: Package the Arxivite app as an Electron desktop application
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: 2025-04-27
**Last Active**: 2025-04-27
**Dependencies**: T0, T1, T2, T3, T5, T7

## Completion Criteria
- Electron builds successfully complete without errors
- Application runs properly in Electron container
- All features work in desktop environment
- Development workflow for Electron established
- Production builds generate installable packages

## Implementation Steps
1. â¬œ Fix TypeScript compilation issues for Electron main process
2. â¬œ Resolve electron-builder packaging errors
3. â¬œ Set up proper development workflow
4. â¬œ Implement desktop-specific features
5. â¬œ Set up production build pipeline

## Attempted Approaches
1. Standard electron-builder setup with dist/electron output - Failed due to file location issues
2. Direct electron directory compilation - Failed due to module system conflicts
3. Vite Electron plugin integration - Incomplete due to build configuration issues

## Technical Requirements
- Properly configured TypeScript compilation for Electron files
- Working electron-builder setup
- IPC communication between main and renderer processes
- Proper separation of development and production builds

## Notes
- Current blockers are primarily around TypeScript compilation and file location issues
- Need to resolve module system conflicts between ESM and CommonJS
- Build process needs significant refinement
