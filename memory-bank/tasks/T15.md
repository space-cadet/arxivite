# T15: Profile and Settings Enhancement & Reorganization
*Created: 2025-05-13*
*Updated: 2025-05-13*

## Description
Enhance and reorganize the Profile and Settings pages by implementing proper separation of concerns, adding paper caching, and establishing a clear distinction between display/interaction and configuration management. This includes removing redundancy between pages and creating a more intuitive user experience.
